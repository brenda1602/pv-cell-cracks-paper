abstract = {Electroluminescence (EL) images enable defect detection in solar photovoltaic (PV) modules that are otherwise invisible to the naked eye, much the same way an x-ray enables a doctor to detect cracks and fractures in bones. This paper presents a benchmark dataset and results for automatic detection and classification using deep learning models trained on 24 defects and features in EL images of crystalline silicon solar cells. The dataset consists of 593 cell images with ground truth masks corresponding to the pixel-level labels for each feature and defect. Four deep learning models (U-Net_12, U-Net_25, PSPNet, and DeepLabv3+) were trained using equal class weights, inverse class weights, and custom class weights for a total of twelve sets of predictions for each of 50 test images. The model performance was quantified based on the median intersection over union (mIoU) and median recall (mRcl) for a subset of the most common defects (cracks, inactive areas, and gridline defects) and features (ribbon interconnects and cell spacing) in the dataset. The mIoU measured higher for the two features compared to the three defects across all models which correlates with the size of the large features compared to the small defects that each class occupies in the images. The DeepLabv3+ with custom class weights scores the highest in terms of mIoU for the selected defects in this dataset. While the mIoU for cracks is low (25%) even for the DeepLabv3+, the recall is high (86%), and the resulting prediction masks reliably locate the defects in complex images with both large and small objects. Therefore, the model proves useful in the context of detecting cracks and other defects in EL images. The unique contributions from this work include the benchmark dataset with corresponding ground truth masks for multi-class semantic segmentation in EL images of solar PV cells and the performance metrics from four semantic segmentation models trained using three sets of class weights.}

abstract = {Electroluminescence (EL) images enable defect detection in solar photovoltaic (PV) modules that are otherwise invisible to the naked eye, much the same way an x-ray enables a doctor to detect cracks and fractures in bones. The prevalence of multiple defects, e.g. micro cracks, inactive regions, gridline defects, and material defects, in PV module can be quantified with an EL image. Modern, deep learning techniques for computer vision can be applied to extract the useful information contained in the images on entire batches of PV modules. Defect detection and quantification in EL images can improve the efficiency and the reliability of PV modules both at the factory by identifying potential process issues and at the PV plant by identifying and reducing the number of faulty modules installed. In this work, we train and test a semantic segmentation model based on the u-net architecture for EL image analysis of PV modules made from mono-crystalline and multi-crystalline silicon wafer-based solar cells. This work is focused on developing and testing a deep learning method for computer vision that is independent of the equipment used to generate the EL images, independent of the wafer-based module design, and independent of the image quality.}

    abstract     = {The use of solar energy has been growing more and more and becoming an important source for the composition of the world energy mix. Photovoltaic modules are capable of converting solar radiation into electrical energy. The production of electric energy by photovoltaic conversion is directly related to the availability of solar radiation, module inclination, the efficiency of the systems involved, degradation, among other factors. This dissertation presents an evaluation of the mechanical damage in photovoltaic cells, by microcracks and other types of degradation, through images of electroluminescence, I-V curve, and visual inspection. Therefore, several modules available at the Solar Energy Laboratory of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (Labsol-UFRGS) were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, to relate degradation to the impact on power. Modules were analyzed in different conditions before and after mechanical tests. Some photovoltaic modules, despite presenting a good visual aspect, showed considerable degradation, thus impacting their power. On the other hand, modules with some damaged cells still presented measured values of maximum power similar to the nominal values. Modules of 60 cells showed greater resistance to mechanical tests than modules with 72 cells. Some modules showed an increase in power after the mechanical test, despite the increase in micro cracks, considering that internal contacts were also reestablished. From these observations, it was found that in the cells in which the microcracks did not obtain total contact break, the loss of power is almost imperceptible, however it is likely be an impact with the propagation of the defect over the time of operation.

abstract = {Electroluminescent imaging is increasingly used to detect defects in silicon solar cells. However, the cost of the conventional luminescence systems is a limiting factor for generalized use. A simple and reliable low-cost electroluminescence setup is presented. The developed system was tested on commercial silicon solar cells for the acquisition of electroluminescence images in the forward and reverse bias regimes. In forward bias the temperature was varied whilst in reverse bias the applied voltage was varied. The results used in conjunction allowed for the detection of defective areas and identification of their type and cause. The simplicity and low-cost nature of the developed setup should enable a more widespread use of luminescence techniques for the characterization of crystalline silicon solar cells.}
